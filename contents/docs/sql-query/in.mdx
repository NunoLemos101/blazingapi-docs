The `filter` method also supports the `IN` operator by adding the suffix `__in` to the field name.

This allows you to filter records based on a list of values.

## Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.filter(id__in=[1, 2, 3])
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
```
