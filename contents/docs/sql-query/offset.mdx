The `all` method supports offsetting the results returned by using Python's list slicing syntax. This translates to the `OFFSET` clause in SQL.

This allows you to skip a specific number of records before starting to return the results from the database.

## Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.all()[10:]
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles OFFSET 10;
```
