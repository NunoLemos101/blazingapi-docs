The `filter` method supports the `AND` operator implicitly. When you provide multiple conditions to the `filter` method, it combines them using the `AND` operator.

This allows you to filter records based on multiple conditions that all need to be true.

## Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.filter(title='Hello World', author='John Doe')
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title = 'Hello World' AND author = 'John Doe';
```
