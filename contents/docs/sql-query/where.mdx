The `filter` method is used to retrieve multiple instances of a model from the database based on the provided criteria.

It translates to the SQL `WHERE` clause.

## Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.filter(title='Hello World')
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title = 'Hello World';
```
