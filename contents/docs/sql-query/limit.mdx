The `all` method supports limiting the number of results returned by using Python's list slicing syntax. This translates to the `LIMIT` clause in SQL.

This allows you to retrieve a specific number of records from the database.

## Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.all()[:10]
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles LIMIT 10;
```
