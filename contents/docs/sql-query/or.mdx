description: Guide to using the `filter` method with the `Q` object for OR conditions in blazingAPI.
---

The `filter` method supports the `OR` operator by using the `Q` object. When you provide multiple conditions to the `Q` object and combine them with the `|` operator, it translates to the `OR` operator in SQL.

This allows you to filter records based on multiple conditions where at least one needs to be true.

## Quick example

```python
from blazingapi.auth.models import User
from blazingapi.orm.query import Q

admin = User.manager.filter(Q(username="admin") | Q(username="root"))
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR username = 'root';
```
