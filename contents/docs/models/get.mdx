The `get` method is a part of the `Manager` class, which is automatically assigned to each `Model` class as the `manager` attribute.

This method allows you to retrieve a single instance of a model from the database based on the provided criteria.

## Quick example

```python
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField, TextField

class Article(Model):

    title = VarCharField(max_length=255)
    content = TextField()

# Retrieve an article with a specific id
article = Article.manager.get(id=10)
