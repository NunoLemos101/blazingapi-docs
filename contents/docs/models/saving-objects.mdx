description: Guide on how to save model instances using BlazingAPI ORM.

In BlazingAPI, saving a model instance involves creating an instance of the model, setting its attributes, and calling the `save` method. This process ensures that the instance is persisted in the database.

## Quick Example

Let's go through an example of saving instances of two models: `Book` and `Article`.


```python
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField, TextField, ForeignKeyField


class Book(Model):
    title = VarCharField(max_length=255)


class Article(Model):
    title = VarCharField(max_length=255)
    content = TextField()
    book = ForeignKeyField(Book)

book = Book(title="The Great Gatsby")
article = Article(title="Chapter 1", content="In my younger and more vulnerable years...", book=book)

# Save the book and article instances
article.save()
```

By calling `article.save()`, BlazingAPI will automatically detect `book` is not saved yet and save it before saving the `article` instance.

Optionally, you can save the `book` instance separately before saving the `article`.

```python
book.save()
article.save()
```
