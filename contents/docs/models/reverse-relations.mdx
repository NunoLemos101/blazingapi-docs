title: Reverse Relations
description: Guide to using the `related_name` attribute to access reverse relations in BlazingAPI.
---

The `related_name` attribute in `ForeignKeyField` allows you to define and access reverse relationships between models. This is useful for querying related objects from the referenced model.

## Overview

When you define a foreign key in a model using `ForeignKeyField`, you can specify a `related_name` attribute. This attribute sets up a reverse relationship, enabling you to easily access related objects from the referenced model.

## Quick Example

Here is a quick example demonstrating how to use `related_name` to access reverse relationships.

```python
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField, ForeignKeyField


class Author(Model):
    name = VarCharField(max_length=256)


class Book(Model):
    title = VarCharField(max_length=256)
    author = ForeignKeyField(Author, related_name='books')


# Retrieve some author
author = Author.manager.get(id=1)

# Access all books by the author
books = author.books.all()

for book in books:
    print(book.title)
```

Behind the scenes, BlazingAPI is executing the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM book WHERE author = 1;
```

## More Complex Example

Here is a more complex example demonstrating how to use `related_name` to access reverse relationships.

```python
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField, ForeignKeyField
from blazingapi.orm.query import Q


class Author(Model):
    name = VarCharField(max_length=256)


class Book(Model):
    title = VarCharField(max_length=256)
    author = ForeignKeyField(Author, related_name='books')


author = Author.manager.get(id=1)

books = author.books.filter(Q(title='The Great Gatsby') | Q(title='Slaughterhouse-Five'))

for book in books:
    print(book.title)
```

Behind the scenes, BlazingAPI is executing the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM book WHERE author = 1 AND (title = 'The Great Gatsby' OR title = 'Slaughterhouse-Five');
```
