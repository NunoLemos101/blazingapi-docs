In BlazingAPI, updating a model instance involves calling the `update` method on the instance and passing the fields to update as keyword arguments. This process ensures that the instance's data is modified in the database.

## Quick Example

Let's go through an example of updating an instance of the `Article` model.

```python
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField, TextField, ForeignKeyField


class Article(Model):
    title = VarCharField(max_length=255)
    content = TextField()


article = Article(title="Chapter 1", content="In my younger and more vulnerable years...")

# Save the article instance
article.save()

# Update the article instance
article.update(title="Chapter 2", content="I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade.")
```
