In BlazingAPI, deleting a model instance involves calling the `delete` method on the instance. This process removes the instance from the database.

## Quick Example

Let's go through an example of deleting an instance of the `Article` model.

```python
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField, TextField, ForeignKeyField


class Article(Model):
    title = VarCharField(max_length=255)
    content = TextField()


articles = Article.manager.all()

for article in articles:
    article.delete()
```
