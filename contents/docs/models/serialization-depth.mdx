title: Serialization Depth
description: Guide to setting the serialization depth of a model
---

If your model has relationships with other models, you can control how deep the serialization goes by setting the `depth_serialization_fields` property on the model.

In this property, you can specify a list of `ForeignKeyField` and `OneToOneField` fields you want to serialize and the serialization will go deeper and serialize the fields of the related model.

When the serialization goes deeper, it will recursively call `serialize()` method of the related model and obey to the `serializable_fields` and  `depth_serialization_fields` properties set on the related model, allowing you to control the serialization on multiple levels.

## Quick Example

```python
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField, TextField, ForeignKeyField


class Author(Model):

    name = VarCharField(max_length=255)


class Book(Model):

    serializable_fields = ['id', 'title', 'author']
    depth_serialization_fields = ['author']

    title = VarCharField(max_length=255)
    sensitive_information = VarCharField(max_length=255)
    author = ForeignKeyField(Author)


class Article(Model):

    depth_serialization_fields = ['book']

    title = VarCharField(max_length=255)
    content = TextField()
    book = ForeignKeyField(Book)


author = Author(name='F. Scott Fitzgerald')
author.save()

book = Book(title='The Great Gatsby', sensitive_information="*", author=author)
book.save()

article = Article(title='The Great Gatsby', content='A great book', book=book)
article.save()

print(article.serialize())
```

The output of `article.serialize()` will be a `dict` object with the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Great Gatsby",
    "content": "A great book",
    "book": {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "The Great Gatsby",
        "author": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
        }
    }
}
```

<Note title={"Warning - Avoid infinite recursion"} type="warning">

    Be careful when setting the `depth_serialization_fields` property, as it can lead to infinite recursion if not used properly.

    For more control over the serialization, you can override the `serialize()` method of the model and manually serialize the related models.

    View the [Serialization Guide](/docs/models/serialization) for more information.
