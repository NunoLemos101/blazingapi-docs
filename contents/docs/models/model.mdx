The `Model` class serves as a base class for creating database models. It provides methods for creating tables, saving, updating, deleting, and serializing model instances. Other classes should inherit from `Model` to leverage these functionalities.

## Quick example

```python
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField, TextField

class Article(Model):

    title = VarCharField(max_length=255)
    content = TextField()
```
