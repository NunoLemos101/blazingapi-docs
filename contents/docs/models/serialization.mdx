The `Model` class includes a `serialize()` method that converts model instances into dictionaries.

The `serialize()` method is called when you pass a model instance to the `Response` object inside a view.

By default, `serialize()` includes all fields of the model or only the fields specified in `serializable_fields`. However, you might need to customize serialization to include additional information or change the format.

## Quick Example

Here's a quick example of how you can override the `serialize()` method in a model class to customize serialization:

```python
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField, TextField

class Article(Model):

    serializable_fields = ['title', 'content']

    title = VarCharField(max_length=256)
    content = TextField()
    sensitive_data = VarCharField(max_length=256)

    def serialize(self):

        # Default serialization of specified fields
        serialized_data = super().serialize()

        # Add custom fields or transform existing ones
        serialized_data['summary'] = self.content[:100]

        return serialized_data
```

In this example, the `sensitive_data` field is not included in the `serializable_fields` list, so it won't be serialized by `super().serialize()`.

Also, the `serialize()` method is overridden to include a custom `summary` field that contains the first 100 characters of the `content` field.
