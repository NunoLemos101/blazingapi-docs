The `filter` method is a part of the `Manager` class, which is automatically assigned to each `Model` class as the `manager` attribute.

This method allows you to retrieve multiple instances of a model from the database based on the provided criteria.

## Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.filter(title='Hello World')
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title = 'Hello World';
```

## IN Operator

You can use the `in` operator to filter based on multiple values. For example:

```python
articles = Article.manager.filter(id__in=[1, 2, 3])
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
```
