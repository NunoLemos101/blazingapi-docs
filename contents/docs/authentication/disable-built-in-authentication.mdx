title: Disable Built-in Authentication
description: Guide to completely deactivating authentication in blazingAPI by modifying `settings.py`.
---

If you need to disable authentication in your blazingAPI application or implement your own, you can do so by removing specific components related to authentication from your `settings.py` file. This involves removing the authentication middleware, authentication models, views, and relevant endpoints.

### How a `settings.py` file looks with authentication disabled

```python
VIEW_FILES = [
    # "blazingapi.auth.views",
    "views",
]

MODEL_FILES = [
    # "blazingapi.auth.models",
    "models",
]

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
    "blazingapi.security.middleware.CorsMiddleware",
    "blazingapi.security.middleware.XFrameOptionsMiddleware",
    # "blazingapi.auth.middleware.BearerAuthenticationMiddleware",
]

DB_FILE = "db.sqlite3"

# LOGIN_ENDPOINT = "/api/auth/login"
# REGISTER_ENDPOINT = "/api/auth/register"
# ME_ENDPOINT = "/api/auth/me"

X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY"

CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["*"]
CORS_ALLOWED_METHODS = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]
CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS = ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
```

## Steps to Disable Authentication

### 1. Remove Authentication Models

Authentication models are responsible for managing user authentication in your application. To deactivate authentication, remove the `blazingapi.auth.models` module from the `MODEL_FILES` list in `settings.py`.

This will prevent the application from creating the `User` table.

```python
MODEL_FILES = [
    ...
    "blazingapi.auth.models", # <- Remove this one
    ...
]
```

### 2. Remove Authentication Views

Authentication views are responsible for handling user authentication in your application. To deactivate the built-in views, remove the `blazingapi.auth.views` module from the `VIEW_FILES` list in `settings.py`.

This will prevent the application from rendering the authentication views.

```python
VIEW_FILES = [
    ...
    "blazingapi.auth.views", # <- Remove this one
    ...
]
```

### 3. Remove Authentication Middleware

Authentication middleware is responsible for handling authentication logic in your application. To deactivate authentication, remove the `BearerAuthenticationMiddleware` from the `MIDDLEWARE` list in `settings.py`.

```python
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
    ...
    "blazingapi.auth.middleware.BearerAuthenticationMiddleware", # <- Remove this one
    ...
]
```

### 4. Remove Authentication Endpoints

Authentication path endpoints are used by `blazingapi.auth.views`.

By removing the `blazingapi.auth.views` module from the `VIEW_FILES` list, the authentication endpoints will no longer be used in your application so they can be safely removed.

```python
LOGIN_ENDPOINT = "/api/auth/login" # <- Remove LOGIN_ENDPOINT variable
REGISTER_ENDPOINT = "/api/auth/register" # <- Remove REGISTER_ENDPOINT variable
ME_ENDPOINT = "/api/auth/me" # <- Remove ME_ENDPOINT variable
```
