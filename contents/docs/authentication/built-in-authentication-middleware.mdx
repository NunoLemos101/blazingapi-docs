Namespace `blazingapi.auth.middleware`

The `BearerAuthenticationMiddleware` class is a middleware component that is responsible for handling Bearer Token Authentication in your application. It extends the `BaseMiddleware` class and modifies the request object based on the Authorization header.

## Class Definition

```python
from blazingapi.auth.models import User, AnonymousUser
from blazingapi.middleware import BaseMiddleware


class BearerAuthenticationMiddleware(BaseMiddleware):

    def execute_before(self, request) -> None:
        auth_header = request.headers.get('Authorization')
        if not auth_header or not auth_header.startswith('Bearer '):
            request.user = AnonymousUser()
            return

        token = auth_header.split(' ')[1]
        user = User.manager.get(token=token)

        if user is None:
            request.user = AnonymousUser()
            return

        request.user = user
