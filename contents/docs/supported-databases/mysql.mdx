When deploying a BlazingAPI project, you can choose to use MySQL as your database. This guide will show you how to set up MySQL with BlazingAPI.

The connection is defined by the property `DB_CONNECTION` in the `settings.py` file.

To use MySQL, you need to specify the following attributes in the `DB_CONNECTION` dictionary:

- `driver`: The database driver to use. For MySQL, use `mysql`.
- `host`: The hostname of the database server.
- `port`: The port number of the database server.
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to.
- `user`: The username to use when connecting to the database.
- `password`: The password to use when connecting to the database.

Here is an example of how to configure MySQL in the `settings.py` file:

```python
import os
...
DB_CONNECTION = {
    'driver': 'mysql',
    'host': os.environ['MYSQL_HOST'],
    'port': '3306',
    'database': os.environ['DATABASE_NAME']
    'user': os.environ['USERNAME'],
    'password': os.environ['PASSWORD']
}
...
```

Now BlazingAPI will use MySQL as the database for your project.

    BlazingAPI uses the `mysql-connector-python` library to connect to MySQL databases.
