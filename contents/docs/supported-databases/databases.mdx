description: Databases supported by BlazingAPI

BlazingAPI officially supports the following databases:

- [SQLite](/database-support/supported-databases/sqlite)
- [PostgreSQL](/database-support/supported-databases/postgresql)
- [MySQL](/database-support/supported-databases/mysql)

BlazingAPI attempts to support as many features as possible on all database backends. However, not all database backends are alike, and weâ€™ve had to make design decisions on which features to support and which assumptions we can make safely.
