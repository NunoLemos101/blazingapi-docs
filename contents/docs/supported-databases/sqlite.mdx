description: Guide to using SQLite with BlazingAPI

When you create a new BlazingAPI project, it comes connected to a SQLite database by default. This is a great way to get started quickly.

The connection is defined by the property `DB_CONNECTION` in the `settings.py` file.

```python
...
DB_CONNECTION = {
    "driver": "sqlite",
    "database": "db.sqlite3"
}
...
```

The `database` key specifies the path to the SQLite database file. By default, it is set to `db.sqlite3` in the root of the project.
