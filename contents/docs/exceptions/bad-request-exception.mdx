Namespace `blazingapi.exceptions`

The `BadRequestException` class is a subclass of the `APIException` class.

It should be raised when the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error.

## Class Definition

```python
class BadRequestException(APIException):
    status_code = 400
    default_detail = 'The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.'
    default_code = 'bad_request'
```
