description: Guide on how to create a custom permission class to restrict access based on user roles.
---

You can create custom permissions by subclassing the `Permission` class and implementing the `__call__` method. This allows you to enforce more granular access control in your web API.

## Real-World Example

Below is an example of a custom permission class called `HasRole`, which allows access based on specific user roles.

### Define a Model

First, ensure that you have the required models and validators in place to manage user roles.

```python
# models.py
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import ForeignKeyField, TextField
from blazingapi.orm.validators import ChoiceValidator
from blazingapi.auth.models import User

class Role(Model):

    ROLE_CHOICES = ['books.read', 'books.write', 'books.delete']

    user = ForeignKeyField(User, related_name='roles')
    role = TextField(validators=[ChoiceValidator(ROLE_CHOICES)])
```

### Define a Custom Permission Class

Next, create a custom permission class called `HasRole` that restricts access based on the user's role.

```python
# permissions.py
from blazingapi.permissions import BasePermission
from blazingapi.auth.exceptions import PermissionDeniedException


class HasRole(BasePermission):
    def __init__(self, role):
        self.role = role

    def __call__(self, request, view):
        if user.roles.get(role=self.role) is None:
            raise PermissionDeniedException()
```

### Using the Custom Permission

Finally, use the custom permission class in your views to restrict access based on user roles.

```python
# views.py
from blazingapi.app import app

from permissions import HasRole


@app.get('/books', permissions=[HasRole('books.read')])
def get_books(request):
    """
    Get a list of books
    """

@app.post('/books', permissions=[HasRole('books.write')])
def create_book(request):
    """
    Create a new book
    """

@app.delete('/books', permissions=[HasRole('books.delete')])
def delete_book(request):
    """
    Delete a book
    """
```
