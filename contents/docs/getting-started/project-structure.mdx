The `Project Structure` section provides an overview of the key files and directories in a BlazingAPI project, helping you understand and organize your code effectively.

## Overview

Welcome to the `Project Structure` section. Here, you'll find all the information you need to get started with organizing your BlazingAPI application.

## Project Files

In a typical BlazingAPI project, you'll find the following core files:

`main.py`

`views.py`

`models.py`

`settings.py`

`db.sqlite3`

<hr/>

### `main.py`

This is the entry point for running your BlazingAPI application. It imports the required `run` method from BlazingAPI's server module and executes it.

BlazingAPI will run the server on the default port `8000`. You can change the port by passing the `port` argument to the `run` method.

The server will be served using Gunicorn if the local machine is running on a Unix-based operating system. Otherwise, it will be served using the built-in `http.server` module.

```python
# main.py
from blazingapi.server import run

run()
```

### `views.py`

This file contains the view functions that handle incoming requests and return responses. Each view function is a Python function that takes a request object as an argument and returns a response object.

```python
# views.py
from blazingapi.app import app
from blazingapi.response import Response


@app.get("/index")
def index(request):
    return Response(body={"message": "Hello, world!"})
```

### `models.py`

This file contains the data models that represent the structure of your application's data. You can define classes that inherit from the `Model` class provided by BlazingAPI to create data models.

File comes empty by default but you can define your models as shown below.

```python
# models.py
from blazingapi.orm.models import Model
from blazingapi.orm.fields import VarCharField

class Article(Model):

    title = VarCharField(max_length=256)
    content = TextField()
```

### `settings.py`

This file contains the configuration settings for your BlazingAPI application. You can define settings such as middleware classes, view files and database settings.

```python
VIEW_FILES = [
    "blazingapi.auth.views",
    "views",
]

MODEL_FILES = [
    "blazingapi.auth.models",
    "models"
]

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
    "blazingapi.security.middleware.CorsMiddleware",
    "blazingapi.security.middleware.XFrameOptionsMiddleware",
    "blazingapi.auth.middleware.BearerAuthenticationMiddleware",
]

DB_FILE = "db.sqlite3"

LOGIN_ENDPOINT = "/api/auth/login"
REGISTER_ENDPOINT = "/api/auth/register"
ME_ENDPOINT = "/api/auth/me"

X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY"

CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["*"]
CORS_ALLOWED_METHODS = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]
CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS = ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
```

### `db.sqlite3`

This file is the default SQLite database file used by BlazingAPI. You can use this file to store your application's data.

For production you can change `settings.py` to use a different database.
