The `get` method is a part of the `QuerySet` class.

This method allows you to retrieve a single instance of a model from the database based on the provided criteria.

## Quick example

```python
from models import Article

article = Article.manager.get(id=1)
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE id = 1;
```

The difference between the `get` method and the `filter` method is that the `get` method will return a single instance of the model, while the `filter` method will return a list of instances even if the number of rows is 1.
