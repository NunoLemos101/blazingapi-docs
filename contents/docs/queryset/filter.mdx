The `filter` method is a part of the `QuerySet` class.

This method allows you to retrieve multiple instances of a model from the database based on the provided criteria.

## Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.filter(title='Hello World')
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title = 'Hello World';
```

## Chain multiple filters

Because querysets are lazily evaluated, you can chain multiple filters together to create more complex queries.

```python
from models import Article

query = Article.manager.filter(title='Hello World')

author = input('Enter author name: ')

if author != '':
    query = query.filter(author=author)
```

<hr/>

## AND operator

The `filter` method supports the `AND` operator implicitly. When you provide multiple conditions to the `filter` method, it combines them using the `AND` operator.

This allows you to filter records based on multiple conditions that all need to be true.

### Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.filter(title='Hello World', author='John Doe')
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title = 'Hello World' AND author = 'John Doe';
```

<hr/>

## IN operator

The `filter` method also supports the `IN` operator by adding the suffix `__in` to the field name.

This allows you to filter records based on a list of values.

### Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.filter(id__in=[1, 2, 3])
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
```

<hr/>

## OR operator

The `filter` method supports the `OR` operator by using the `Q` object. When you provide multiple conditions to the `Q` object and combine them with the `|` operator, it translates to the `OR` operator in SQL.

This allows you to filter records based on multiple conditions where at least one needs to be true.

### Quick example

```python
from blazingapi.auth.models import User
from blazingapi.orm.query import Q

admin = User.manager.filter(Q(username="admin") | Q(username="root"))
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR username = 'root';
```

## LIMIT operator

The `all` and `filter` methods support limiting the number of results returned by using Python's list slicing syntax. This translates to the `LIMIT` clause in SQL.

This allows you to retrieve a specific number of records from the database.

### Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.all()[:10]
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles LIMIT 10;
```

<hr/>

## OFFSET operator

The `all` and `filter` methods support offsetting the results returned by using Python's list slicing syntax. This translates to the `OFFSET` clause in SQL.

This allows you to skip a specific number of records before starting to return the results from the database.

### Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.all()[10:]
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles OFFSET 10;
```

<hr/>

The difference between the `get` method and the `filter` method is that the `get` method will return a single instance of the model, while the `filter` method will return a list of instances even if the number of rows is 1.
