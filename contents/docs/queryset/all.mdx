the `all` method is used to retrieve all the records from the database.

It translates to the SQL `SELECT * FROM` clause.

## Quick example

```python
from models import Article

articles = Article.manager.all()
```

This would translate to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles;
```
